# Order Management Application

# Description
It uses reflection techniques in order to create an application meant for other people's orders. The user of the application can see the log of orders, the products, 
add orders for a specific client and a product, as well as adding, removing, modifying and viewing the data for clients and products. 
The main objective of this application was to follow the SOLID principles, making the code reusable and easy to maintain.
